Tours structure:

  - "Gardens nearby" feature 
  		Best done using GPS, beacon ranges are far too small to have any meaningful impact on this.
  - Tour patterns 
  	 	Initially should be structured in a straightforward way.  Future improvements can be a mixture of existing curated tours and dynamically created personalized tours, but to start the focus should be on the curated tours.
  - Tour guide
  		Use beacons to show stops on a map, using JavaScript
  - Details
  		]-	See JSON file for data model
  		]-	Showing the details during the tour would operate via beacon IDs
